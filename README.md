#### Deliverable 3:

### Overview:

W. Avy wants information about temperature trends before opening his surf and ice-cream shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Results:

In order to extract the temperature data for the month of June, I wrote my code such that it would use the month '6' as a condition when retrieving the temperatures for June from the hawaii.sqlite dataset.  The June temperatures retrieved as follows:

Afterwards I ran my statistical analysis on the June temperatures. Here is what i gathered:

According to the June temperature stats: 

#   The mean June temperature is 71°F, with a max of 83°F and min of 56°F. This places Oahu in a favorable place for surfing and ice-cream conditions.
#   The data was retrieved using 1517 data points over the span of 8 years. It gives a balanced representation of the June temperatures in Oahu.
#   Standard deviation is 3.74 from the mean, which goes to say that the temperature results are pretty consistent.











For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
